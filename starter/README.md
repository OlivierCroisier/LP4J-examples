Starter
==========

Minimal working applications using the LP4J API.

- `StarterMidi` shows how to connect to a physical Launchpad device.
- `StarterEmuWeb` starts a web emulator on port 9000.

Both use the same application logic : turn on a random-colored light under a pressed pad, and a red light under
pressed buttons. The STOP button stops the application.

This example application is provided under the Apache licence v2.0.
